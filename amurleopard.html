        <h2>Long Leaps</h2>
		<p>People usually think of lepords in the savannas of Africa but in the Russian far east, a rare species has adapted to live  in the temperate forests that make up the nothern-most part of the species' range. Similar to other lepords, the amur leopord cun up to 37 miles per hour. They can leap more than 19 feet horizontally and up to 10 feet vertically!

		<h2>Why Are They Endangerd</h2>
        <p>They are poached largely for their beautiful fur. In 1999,an undercover investigationteam recovered a female and male amur leopard skin, which were being sold for $500 and $1,000 respectively in the of Barabash,not far from the Kedrovaya Pad reserve in Russia.Agriculture and villages surround the forests where the lepords live.so forestsare accessible,makeing poaching a problem.<p>
